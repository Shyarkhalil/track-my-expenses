# Building ExpenseList

## Description
Building ExpenseList is a simple expense tracker mini-project built with React. It allows users to add new expenses using a form at the top of the page. The form includes validation to ensure that values are entered before submitting. Once an item is added, it appears in the list of expenses below, and the form is cleared for new entries.

Users can filter the expenses by category, and the list updates accordingly. Each item in the list displays the description, amount, and total. The user can also delete an item using the delete button. This project serves as a fantastic way to practice and improve React skills.
